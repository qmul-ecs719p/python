# Python

Instructions for the labs sessions on Python. You can directly browse the following links to check out the lab sheets.

1. [Introduction to Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/qmul-ecs719p/python/blob/master/jupyter-notebook.ipynb): [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/index.html) is an open source web application that you can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. 

2. [Basics of Python](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/qmul-ecs719p/python/blob/master/python-basics.ipynb): to run python codes, you can either copy & paste the codes from the lab sheet and then run them at a python console, or clone/download this repository to run the codes using Jupyter Notebook as introduced below.


### How to run python codes using Jupyter Notebook

1. Installation

- **If you are using machines at G2 or ITL**: machines should be already prepared to run the labs without further setup. 

- **If you are using your own computer**: we **strongly recommend** installing Python and Jupyter using the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), which includes Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science. **We recommend downloading Anacondaâ€™s latest Python 3 version.**

2. Clone/Download the repository: run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows)
```
$ git clone https://github.com/qmul-ecs719p/python.git
```

3. Congratulations, you can launch the notebook now by running the following command:
```
$ jupyter notebook
```

This will present the notebook in your browser. You can navigate to the `python` folder and open a `.ipynb` file to run python code cell by cell. See [Running the Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running) for more details.
